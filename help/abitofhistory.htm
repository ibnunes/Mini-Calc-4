<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts18">A bit of history...</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">I introduced myself in programming when I bought my first graphical calculator - a TI 84 Plus Silver Edition. With just the user manual, using a simples table of commands in its end, I learned to create tiny programs with it. Quickly I made very useful programs for math, chem and physics.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Two years later I learned in school the basic stuff about Pascal, a popular programming language created in 1971 by Niklaus Wirth. It's still my favorite language today and with it I made some useful programs.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">With just three or four weeks of </span><span class="rvts15">Pascal</span><span class="rvts6">, I created a very tiny and unuseful calculator just for fun, and I called it Mini Calc. Without knowing it, I was creating my most beloved project of my life. Sure it wasn't, and it isn't, something great, but even not knowing why I just love this project.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">In about three months I created several versions of Mini Calc in a range of 4 series:</span></p>
<ul style="text-indent: 0px; margin-left: 24px; list-style-position: outside; list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts15">Zero Series</span><span class="rvts6"> was the initial prototype;</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts15">1</span><span class="rvts19">st</span><span class="rvts15"> and 2</span><span class="rvts19">nd</span><span class="rvts15"> Series</span><span class="rvts6"> introduced the main systems of Mini Calc;</span></li>
<li class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The </span><span class="rvts15">3</span><span class="rvts19">rd</span><span class="rvts15"> Series</span><span class="rvts6"> was the most mature, programmed from scratch and implementing huge improvements in usability.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Still, Mini Calc laked some power and ease-of-use. Furthermore, its calculation system was terrible: you only could introduce an operator and its operands at a time. To calculate bigger expressions, you needed to "dance" a lot with the Memory Manager (system introduced with the 3rd Series).</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts12">The 3</span><span class="rvts23">rd</span><span class="rvts12"> Series</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">With this series, the introduction of numbers was very secure - if you introduced letters with the older series, the program would crash. It was possible to use </span><span class="rvts15">internal commands</span><span class="rvts6">, such as </span><span class="rvts20">cancel</span><span class="rvts6"> to go back to the main menu or </span><span class="rvts20">mem</span><span class="rvts6"> to use the active memory. You had a stopwatch, a basic system for statistical analysis (very basic!) and for trigonometry.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps3"><img width="546" height="258" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/02_menuprincipal1.png"></p>
<p class="rvps3"><span class="rvts21">Mini Calc 3</span><span class="rvts22">rd</span><span class="rvts21"> Series, version 3.1.2, Main Menu (in Portuguese)</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">This series was a mark of Mini Calc - it was the first near-useful calculator I made with very basic skills in programming.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts12">The 4</span><span class="rvts23">th</span><span class="rvts12"> Series</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Almost five years have passed and my knowledge is much bigger and more mature. I've had contact with other programming languages, have learned from them and, above all, I swam deeper in the Pascal waters.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">With a lot of new "guns" available, I finally decided it was time to implement the next iteration of my beloved "baby project".</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">So, with much less time free, I've implemented the various systems for weeks in the hope to create a truly useful and usable calculator.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The first version isn't exactly the most complete calculator, but it has the basic stuff for a calculator.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">For the first time, the navigation is done with menus in which you can use the up and down arrows to select an item. From that item, a submenu can show additional options.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">One can introduce complete expressions and Mini Calc can evaluate them for the very first time - now it can evaluate expressions such as "</span><span class="rvts20">tan(degtorad(60)) * ($pi - 1)</span><span class="rvts6">". And... it has a graphical calculator! In the first version you can't "navigate" through the functions - it isn't interactive -, but you can save a BMP image of the screen.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">The user interface is much cleaner, simpler and user-friendly.</span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps2"><span class="rvts6">Read the topics of this help file and to get familiar with this new series of </span><span class="rvts15">Mini Calc, the Minimalist Calculator</span><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
